# Sticky Notes App  

A small React + TypeScript app for creating and managing digital sticky notes.  
You can create notes, move them around, resize from the corner, edit content inline, and delete them. Notes stack properly with z‑index management, giving a natural “board” experience.  

Built with **React, Vite, and TypeScript** to keep the code modular and fast — note state and drag/resize interactions are encapsulated in custom hooks for a clean architecture.
